# Zero

### Project Description
    Zero is an IOS mobile application that encourages users to reduce waste by helping them manage and track expiration dates of perishable 
    products such as food and cosmetics. The application is currently being designed and built by a capstone team from the Information School 
    at the University of Washington, Seattle. Driven by sustainability, simplicity, and being human-centered, the application is still at 
    its early stage and will be refined iteratively during Spring 2020. Thank you and stay tuned!

### Problem Statement
    How might environmentally conscious people raise awareness of expiration dates of perishable foods and cosmetics 
    so that they can plan their shopping accordingly, save money, and potentially reduce food waste?
