# Zero

### Project Description
    Zero is an IOS mobile application that encourages users to reduce waste by helping them manage and track expiration dates of perishable 
    products such as food and cosmetics. The application is currently being designed and built by a capstone team from the Information School 
    at the University of Washington, Seattle. Driven by sustainability, simplicity, and being human-centered, the application is still at 
    its early stage and will be refined iteratively during Spring 2020. Thank you and stay tuned!

### Problem Statement
    How might environmentally conscious people raise awareness of expiration dates of perishable foods and cosmetics 
    so that they can plan their shopping accordingly, save money, and potentially reduce food waste?

### Code Build and Deployment
    Based on our discussion right now, we have decided to implement the app with React Native, which is a JavaScript framwork, as the frontend and NodeJs as the backend. We are also considering construct our own database for easier data analysis. Bacause we are still in the early stage, we have not yet discussed the app deployment, but I assume I will use Amazon Web Service as the deployment tool because each of us has used it before.

### Code Contributions
    Our three engineers will contribute to the development through Git and Github. Git is an convenient version control system that allows us to collaborate effectively. To avoid conflict issues, each of us will create git branches respectively and work on that. After we confirm our branches are all bug free, we will merge them together. Github will also automatically track how much code each of us contributed.
